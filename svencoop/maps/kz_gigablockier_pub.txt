The super secret area on a2_blockrunner 
contains 2 jump sections from Kreedz,
intended for Gigablockier.

These 2 sections are outtakes and
will only appear on that map. It is the painful
glass cube and torture high duck jump thingie..
Both were originally placed just before the old
end room on Gigablockier.

=============================
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM RUNNING THIS MAP
=============================

To run some large maps (like this one) you need to raise a
setting num_edicts, which you can do in two ways. Either as
a launch option setting or in the liblist.gam file. This also is
for you as server owner.

LAUNCH OPTION:
Right click on steam icon and select LIBRARY.
Right click on Counter-Strike in the list and select PROPERTIES.
Click on "SET LAUNCH OPTIONS..."
Type in    -num_edicts 4096   and press OK.

OR LIBLIST.GAM FILE:
Could be located in different locations, like
/steamapps/common/half-life/modfolder/
/steamapps/your_email/counter-strike/cstrike/

Open it with notepad, and find the setting
edicts      "1800"
Change the 1800 to 4096, save and exit.
If the setting isn't there, add it.

This will help you get rid of the errors:
"Host_Error: CL_EntityNum: 1366 is an invalid number"
"ED_Alloc No Free Edicts"
