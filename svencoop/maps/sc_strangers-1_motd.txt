-=STORY=-
	A call warned about Gman stalking around a remote area of Black
	Mesa, we don't know what his mysterious agenda is, but one
	thing's assured: He must be stopped.

	Now you and your squad must stop him with the help of some HECU
	marines, it isn't a surprise that Black Mesa is still a zone with
	a lot of alien activity. Reports indicate high levels of Xen
	wildlife presence as well as the new "Race X", bio-mech units 
	and even unidentified enemies. Be careful!
